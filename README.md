Monte Carlo simulations for exploring the polaron and bipolaron physics motivated by properties like superconductivity of bismuthates.

Define the phonon frequency and harmonic coefficient k accordingly:

w = sqrt(2k/M) = sqrt(2)*t_sp with the unit to be eV so that k = M*t_sp^2

Because the atomic mass of O is 15.9994 amu = 2.656762641e-26 kg, and if t_sp=2.08eV,
then k = 1.149421789e-25 kg*eV^2
